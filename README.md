# Relearning algorithms with 10 years of hindsight

## Goal and motivation
I hated algorithm classes at university. I was always more into electronics, networking and system programming.
However, in my current position as a senior engineer and interviewer, I frequently find myself in a position where
I need to check people's thinking skills or give them suggestions how to improve their code. After solving some
interview questions myself, I noticed I forgot many optimal ways of solving problems. Problems, for which 
mathematically proven optimal solutions exist. To that end, I want to re-learn a couple of major algorithms.
to both improve my design skills and my interview skills.

My plan is as follows:
1. Implement at least one algorithm/data structure from the following categories:
- [ ] Sorting
- [ ] Tree traversal 
- [x] Dynamic programming ([Dijkstra](./dijkstra.py), A*)
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Hashing algorithm
- [ ] Asymmetric cryptography
- [ ] Image processing (e.g. unsharp mask)

## Format
Each algorithm should be a single runnable file in Python.

I will implement the algorithm based on the description, note down my questions as I code, then reimplement
after reading on the best known solution.
